            This assignment focuses on utilizing React, API's, Models, and Graphs to present expiation data collected by the SA Government.

        </p>
        <ul>    
            <li>The API endpoints are in Assig2/api/EndpointController.cs</li>
            <li>Test them out them via the Swagger link.</li>
            <li>You can also test them via Get at localhost:[port]/api/[Endpoint]?querystring</li>
            <li>So, to access the Login endpoint, go to localhost:[port]/api/Login?userName=foo&passwordhash=bar</li>
            <li>API responses are in JSON</li>
            <li>React has been installed via npx create-react-app in Assig2/a2reactapp/</li>
            <li>But I deleted the `node_modules` to save space, so you'll have to navigate back to Assig2/a2reactapp/ and `npm install`</li>
            <li>Make sure you adjust your database connection in Assig2/appsettings.json</li>
